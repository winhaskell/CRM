Defining CRM


C-R-M stands for Customer Relationship Management. What is CRM? 
At its simplest definition, a CRM system allows businesses to manage business relationships and 
the data and information associated with them.

With CRM, you can store customer and prospect contact information, accounts, leads, and sales
opportunities in one central location, ideally in the cloud so the information is accessible by many, in real time.

Just like ubiquitous social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, a CRM system is similarly 
built around people and relationships. And that's exactly why it can be so valuable for a fast-growing business.
